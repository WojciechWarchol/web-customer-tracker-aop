# web-customer-tracker-aop
A project done during a Spring course I am doing
It is a simple webb app build on the Spring MVC Framowork. It manages a list of customers and gives the possibility to add, update, remove and search for a person.
It uses Hibernate to communicate with the DB, c3p0 for connection pooling, AOP for logging the actions on the server, and is configured with xml.
